When a natural disaster or other exogenous shock forces individuals to move, the net impact on living standards could be positive or negative. This paper uses longitudinal data from Current Population Surveys conducted between 2004 and 2006 to estimate the net impact of Hurricane Katrina-related evacuation on various indicators of well-being. While evacuees who have returned to the affected region show evidence of returning to normalcy in terms of labor supply and earnings, those who persisted in other locations exhibit large and persistent gaps, even relative to the poor outcomes of New Orleans-area residents prior to the storm. Evacuee outcomes show few if any relationships with host community characteristics, including unemployment and growth rates. The impact of evacuation on total income was blunted to some extent by government transfer payments and by self-employment activities. Overall, there is little evidence to support the notion that poor underemployed residents of the New Orleans area were disadvantaged by their location in a relatively depressed region.  a"Hurricane Katrina, 2005 Economic aspects."1 aNational Bureau of Economic Research.2local40uhttp://www.nber.org/papers/W13022.pdf00350nam  2200097   45000010005000000080041000050400018000462450093000645040052001576530043002090002150324suuuu    xxu      b    0 0 0 eng d  aNNUbengcNNU00aThe Katrina effect :b was there a bright side to the evacuation of greater New Orleans?  aIncludes bibliographical references (p. 31-32).  aNew Orleans (La.)

A qualitative research paradigm was used to understand how the six adults from New Orleans were affected by Hurricane Katrina. Results indicated that the same stressors that were in the African American families after Hurricane Katrina were a staple well before. Limitations were also addressed. The data collected from these contributing adult members of African American families suggest there is a lot more research that need to be conducted concerning forced relocating that includes the effects on family life and the need for government intervention.  aAfrican American families.1 aMiami University (Oxford, Ohio).
